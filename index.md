# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
For my first milestone I made a character for my game. I added the animations for my character than imported him to a Unitity 3D project. I then coded movment abilities for my character. I made fighting mechanics for my character by creating offensive and devensive animations then coding them into the game. Once I was finished with player 1 it was time to start on player 2. Player 2 was a lot easier to make than player 1 because I already made most of the mechanics in player 1.
