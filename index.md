# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
For my first milestone I made a character for my game. I added the animations for my character in blender than imported him to a Unitity 3D project. I then coded movment abilities for my character. I used multible videos to learn how to code the movement because I had never codded before. I needed to restart multible times because the were many bugs in my code. When I finaly finished the movement code I added animations for the movement.
